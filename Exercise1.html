    <li> once the pan is hot put the steak in make sure the pan is on high heat</li>
    <li>Once the steak gets some colour add the thyme and rosemary and add some butter to the pan allowing the butter to carmelized for moe flavour</li>
    <li> After that turn the heat down</li>
    <li> Since we are waiting for the steak to cook cut some potatoes into long shapes</li>
    <li> After that fly the potatoes into  oil and deep fry them for 1 minute and then take them out deep fry them again at a high temp to get that golden brown colour</li>
